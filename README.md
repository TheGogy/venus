# Venus

A chess engine written in Rust and trained on [Lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0) data. Work in progress.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TheGogy/venus.git
make release
```

To run the engine, you'll need a UCI compatible interface, like [Cutechess](https://cutechess.com/) or [En Croissant](https://encroissant.org/).
